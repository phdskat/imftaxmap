IMF Tax Conditionality Map Methodology

For this map, I extracted data from IMF Monitor on all conditionality agreements related to "Revenues and tax issues" (RTP), covering customs administration, tax policy, tax administration, and audits of private enterprises (n=3352, nCountries=114). I then removed Yugoslavia (only dissolved country) for final dataset (n=3349, nCountries=113). Finally I loaded into R and ran the code.
